### ActiveRecord Lite

This is my 'lite' version of Rails ActiveRecord. It features ActiveRecord's Object Relational Mapping functionality. 

- Provides attr_accessor, attr_reader, attr_writer 
- Can query database using Object#all, Object#find
- Can create relations using #belongs_to, #has_many, and #has_one_through associations.
