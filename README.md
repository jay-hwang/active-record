### ActiveRecord Lite

This is my 'lite' version of Rails ActiveRecord. It features the basic functionality of ActiveRecord. You can create attr_accessor/reader/writer, make database queries like Object.all, Object.find, and you can also make belongs_to, has_many, has_one_through associations.

As no project is fully complete without tests, this rendition of ActiveRecord comes with RSpec tests.
